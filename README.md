# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection
Time Series classification for Epileptic Seizure on UCI dataset.

Categorical classification using artificial neural network in two ways,

First, using all the features in the model to allow the neural network to automatically tune according to the relevance of a feature.

Second, using dimensionality reduction to minimize the no. of features fed into the model, with the aim to increase accuracy and decrease no of parameters.
