Categorical classification using artificial neural network in two ways:

First, using all the features in the model to allow the neural network to automatically tune according to the relevance of a feature.

Second, using dimensionality reduction to minimize the no. of features fed into the model, with the aim to increase accuracy and decrease no of parameters.
